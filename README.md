# Javanese-Dialect-Identification-from-Twitter-Data

This repo contains a Twitter dataset for Javanese dialect identification **(JaDi-Ide)**. The dialect is classified into *Standard Javanese, Ngapak Javanese, and East Javanese* dialects.
To classify the dialects, we experimented with two approaches: traditional machine learning and deep learning. For more detail about the experiment results, kindly access our publication [here](https://scholar.archive.org/work/sps3qk2efzdahi7e2pwjhv5z3m/access/wayback/http://kinetik.umm.ac.id/index.php/kinetik/article/download/1121/pdf).
